#Pomodoro Timer

Countdown starts with session time. Once the time is out there is a bell to notify the user it's time for break. When the break time is over the user is once again notified, it's time to get back to work. The cycle is repeated until the user pauses the timer or leaves the page. Session and break time can be set via the buttons. Stack and libraries used for building the app: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, JavaScript, jQuery, Progressbar.js
